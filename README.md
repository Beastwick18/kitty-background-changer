# Kitty Background Manager
A cli program for managing your backgrounds for kitty terminal

This project is WIP for now.
I plan to add the following features:
- [ ] Config file
- [ ] Option to dim image
- [ ] Option to scale and crop image

## Installation
To install Kitty Background Manager, you will have to clone the repository and run

```chmod +x ./install.sh```

from within the repository. After that, you can run the install script. 

The program requires poetry to install correctly. 

## Running the program
Once the program is installed, you can run it by calling

```kittybg``` 

from your terminal

For more information on arguments and options, run it with `--help`

## Background storage

Backgrounds are stored in `/home/$USER/Pictures/kittyWallpapers/` by defualt

In the near future, there will be an option to change the location
